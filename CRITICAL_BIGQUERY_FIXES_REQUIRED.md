# CRITICAL BigQuery Fixes Required - NO WORKAROUNDS

## Executive Summary
The dashboard is displaying incorrect metrics due to fundamental data issues in BigQuery. These MUST be fixed at the source. No frontend workarounds or assumptions should be used.

---

## 1. CRITICAL: Speed to Lead Shows Negative Values

### Current Problem
- Speed to Lead shows **-803 minutes average** (negative 13.4 hours)
- 87% of quotes are sent same-day as the request
- ALL same-day quotes show negative values

### Root Cause
**v_quotes.sent_date is DATE type (00:00:00) instead of TIMESTAMP**
- When a request comes in at 2:00 PM and quote is sent at 4:00 PM same day
- Calculation: sent_date (00:00:00) - requested_on_date (14:00:00) = -14 hours

### REQUIRED FIX in v_quotes view
```sql
-- Current (WRONG):
sent_date DATE  -- This becomes midnight 00:00:00

-- Required (CORRECT):
sent_datetime TIMESTAMP  -- Must capture actual time quote was sent
```

### Data Source Fix
The original Jobber data must have a timestamp for when quotes are sent. This needs to be:
1. Extracted from Jobber API with full timestamp
2. Stored in BigQuery tables with TIMESTAMP type
3. Exposed in v_quotes as `sent_datetime` TIMESTAMP field

---

## 2. CRITICAL: Duplicate Quote Records

### Current Problem
- Quote #1154 appears TWICE in v_quotes
- Dashboard shows 8 quotes when Jobber shows 7
- Both records are identical (same client, amount, status)

### Root Cause
v_quotes view is not deduplicating quotes by quote_number

### REQUIRED FIX in v_quotes view
```sql
-- Add deduplication logic to v_quotes:
WITH deduplicated_quotes AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT 
    quote_number,
    FIRST_VALUE(quote_id) OVER (PARTITION BY quote_number ORDER BY updated_at DESC) as quote_id,
    -- ... other fields ...
  FROM source_quotes_table
)
SELECT * FROM deduplicated_quotes
```

## 3. CRITICAL: Missing September 2025 Data

### Current Problem
- Jobber shows $32,745 for September 2025
- BigQuery v_jobs shows $0
- Dashboard OTB calculations are wrong

### Root Cause
Data sync from Jobber to BigQuery is incomplete:
- `jobber_job_line_items`: 0 September records
- `jobber_jobs`: Empty table (0 total records)
- `jobber_visits`: Has visits but no values

### REQUIRED FIX
1. Fix Jobber â†’ BigQuery sync pipeline
2. Ensure ALL future scheduled jobs are synced
3. Backfill missing September data

---

## 4. CRITICAL: v_jobs Date Filter Blocks Future Jobs

### Current Problem  
- v_jobs has `WHERE Date <= CURRENT_DATE()` 
- This filters out ALL future scheduled work
- OTB metrics show $0 for future periods

### REQUIRED FIX in v_jobs view
```sql
-- Remove this line completely:
WHERE Date <= CURRENT_DATE()  -- DELETE THIS LINE
```

---

## 5. CRITICAL: Job Dollar Categorization is Wrong

### Current Problem
- ALL revenue goes into `One_off_job_dollars`
- `Visit_based_dollars` is always 0
- Can't distinguish between job types

### Root Cause
v_jobs doesn't properly categorize based on job type

### REQUIRED FIX in v_jobs view
```sql
-- Current (WRONG):
COALESCE(CAST(q.total AS FLOAT64), 0.0) as One_off_job_dollars,
0.0 as Visit_based_dollars

-- Required (CORRECT):
-- Must join with job_line_items and categorize based on line item type
CASE 
  WHEN job_type = 'RECURRING' OR line_item_name LIKE '%visit%' 
  THEN amount ELSE 0 
END as Visit_based_dollars,
CASE 
  WHEN job_type = 'ONE_OFF' AND line_item_name NOT LIKE '%visit%' 
  THEN amount ELSE 0 
END as One_off_job_dollars
```

---

## 6. Winter OTB Calculation Missing Data

### Current Problem
- Winter OTB combines Dec 2024 + Jan 2025 + Feb 2025
- No data exists for Dec 2024 (before company launch)
- Query looking for data that will never exist

### REQUIRED FIX
Change Winter OTB definition to Dec 2025 + Jan 2026 + Feb 2026 OR remove the metric entirely until relevant.

---

## Testing After Fixes

### Test 1: Speed to Lead
```sql
-- Should return POSITIVE values
SELECT 
  AVG(TIMESTAMP_DIFF(sent_datetime, requested_on_date, MINUTE)) as avg_minutes
FROM v_requests r
JOIN v_quotes q ON r.quote_number = q.quote_number
WHERE DATE(requested_on_date) >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)

-- Expected: 240-360 minutes (4-6 hours) average
```

### Test 2: Duplicate Quotes
```sql
-- Should return 0 duplicates
SELECT quote_number, COUNT(*) as count
FROM v_quotes
GROUP BY quote_number
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1

-- Expected: 0 rows
```

### Test 3: September Data
```sql
-- Should match Jobber totals
SELECT SUM(Calculated_Value) 
FROM v_jobs
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM Date) = 2025 
  AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM Date) = 9

-- Expected: $32,745
```

---

## Implementation Priority

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Fix v_quotes.sent_date to TIMESTAMP (Speed to Lead)
2. **IMMEDIATE**: Deduplicate quotes in v_quotes 
3. **HIGH**: Fix September 2025 data sync
4. **HIGH**: Remove date filter from v_jobs
5. **MEDIUM**: Fix job dollar categorization

These fixes MUST be implemented in BigQuery views and data pipeline. No frontend workarounds should be used. The dashboard will show incorrect data until these are fixed.

**Dashboard will display wrong metrics until these root causes are fixed.**
